Design a URL shortener service that takes in a valid URL and returns a shortened URL , redirecting the user to the previously provided URL.
Also keeps track of total visits/clicks on URL.

ROUTES:

POST/URL - generates a new short url and returns the shortened URL in format example.com/random-id.
GET/:id - returns the user to the original URL
GET/URL/analytics/:id - Returns the clicks provided by the short id.
